shapely provides runtime reflection for Rust.

Any type that implements `Shapely` trait returns a `Shape`, which describes:

  * The memory layout of the type
  * Its innards: struct fields, underlying type for newtypes, etc.
  * How to invoke its Display/Debug implementation
  * How to drop it in place

The `Partial` type is able to allocate (or work from a `&mut MaybeUninit<T>`)
any Shapely type, and gradually initialize its fields â€” until the fully-built
value is moved out of the partial.

It comes with a derive macro that uses [unsynn](https://crates.io/crates/unsynn)
for speed of compilation.
