{{ header("facet-types") }}

Defines the core types used throughout the facet ecosystem for runtime reflection:

* `Shape`: The central type that describes the memory layout and capabilities of a type
* Various vtables that define how to manipulate types at runtime
* The `Def` tree, which describes type definitions (structs, enums, etc.)

This crate is foundational to facet's reflection capabilities, providing the type system that enables safe runtime type manipulation.

### Key Components

* Memory layout information (size, alignment, etc.)
* Type definition hierarchies
* Runtime type manipulation vtables
* Safe type erasure primitives
