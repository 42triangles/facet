shapely-derive provides procedural macros to derive the `Shapely` trait from shapely.

This crate implements the `#[derive(Shapely)]` macro which automatically generates runtime reflection code for Rust structs, providing:

  * Structure parsing and representation
  * Field access and manipulation
  * Integration with the shapely runtime reflection system

The implementation uses [unsynn](https://crates.io/crates/unsynn) for efficient and fast compilation.
